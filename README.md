# Showcase
What can a developer showcase when all his projects are under NDA? 

Well, just snippets of code for you to view the style, logic, and overall skills.

The code won't work locally since urls were obfuscated, but you can still see the structure and logic.

## parse_site_and_download_pdf

Writing parsers and integrating them into Django was one of my day-to-day tasks. 

Patterns used: PageObject, Facade, Command, and Decorator.

This folder contains a piece of structure from Django project. 
The task was to parse a financial website and download PDF files from it en masse.

This flow was launched periodically (daily, weekly) and the data was stored in the database.

This is solely my work, the code wasn't influenced/checked/blessed by any other person.
