class SitePDFDownloader:
    """A class to manage the downloading of PDF documents from the <Under NDA> website.

    This class processes a list of ISINs, selecting the appropriate investor profile
    and downloading PDFs as needed. It minimizes unnecessary interactions by keeping track
    of the investor profile based on the ISIN's country code.

    Overall logic:
    The parser processes a given list of funds, takes their corresponding ISINs and searches for them on <Under NDA>
    via the search bar. It always selects the "Professional Investor" option and switches the country based on
    the ISINâ€™s country code (for example, "DK0124568" corresponds to Denmark).
    If the country from the ISIN is not available in <Under NDA>'s list,
    the parser tries a short list of other fallback codes.
